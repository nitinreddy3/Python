# Learn Python #5 - Do with functions

## What functions are?

Functions in [Python](python.org) are meant to isolate the different parts of the program in smaller chunks.

Functions shall be easy to read and understand.

## Let us look at an example

Let us say we want to find the volume of a cube so we write

```
def volume(side):
    return side*side*side

print(f"The volume of a cube is {volume(3)} cubic cm")
//The volume of a cube is 27 cubic cm
```

- Here we say that we want to define a function with the keyword `def` which stands for `define` in [python](python.org).
- `volume` is a name given to that function.
- In parenthesis `()` we are passing an argument which is of type number.
- And we end the `()` with `:` so that the indentation (4 spaces) will begin from the next line.
- return the result with the `return` keyword.
- We are calling this method inside a `print` statement where we interpolate the value returned by the function.

## Quick gotchas when you are defining a function

- Function name cannot start with numbers or any special characters.

## Conclusion

There are more posts on the way related to the functions...So keep reading.
